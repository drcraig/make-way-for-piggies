Under a bright blue moon at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusets,
Sally Honda gave birth to a beautiful shining boy named Huxley
Kotaro Craig. Ever since 9:31 PM on Friday, August 31, 2012,
he has been bringing joy to his parents with every thing he does.

For nine months before, though, his name
and gender were unknown. At first, his working name was
"Junior", later modified to be pronouced "Jun-yea!",
as in both a combination of Sally's siblings "Jun" and 
"Lyea" and how Sean Connery says it in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade".
But at an ultrasound one day, he would not sit still. He 
squirmed and wiggled so much that the technician was unable
to get the data she needed, and had to reschedule him for
an additional scan. On that day, he became known as 
"Piggly Wiggly". Later that morphed to "Wiggly", then
"Piggies", and finally shortened to "Piggs".

The pregnancy was not easy on Sally. For 
several months, morning sickness lasted closer to 24 hours a day.
Her nausea eventually subsided, but by then Huxley
had grown large and active enough to not only earn
his moniker, but also to be awarded a prenatal
black belt in kung fu.

On those many late nights and early mornings when 
Piggly woke her up, Sally took to writing verse, 
primarily haiku, but with a few limericks as well.
