Better make process that isolates the build products

Put pictures in a "pictures" or "images" folder instead of "manual"

Fabric to upload only build products, no DS_Store or other crap. 
Also remove any obsolete files on new deployments.

Add version stamp during make

Mobile friendliness. 
* iphone still has some extra space. Force narrower?

Upload to github
