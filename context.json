 "preface": "Under a bright blue moon at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusets,\nSally Honda gave birth to a beautiful shining boy named Huxley\nKotaro Craig. Ever since 9:31 PM on Friday, August 31, 2012,\nhe has been bringing joy to his parents with every thing he does.\n\nFor nine months before, though, his name\nand gender were unknown. At first, his working name was\n\"Junior\", later modified to be pronouced \"Jun-yea!\",\nas in both a combination of Sally's siblings \"Jun\" and \n\"Lyea\" and how Sean Connery says it in \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\".\nBut at an ultrasound one day, he would not sit still. He \nsquirmed and wiggled so much that the technician was unable\nto get the data she needed, and had to reschedule him for\nan additional scan. On that day, he became known as \n\"Piggly Wiggly\". Later that morphed to \"Wiggly\", then\n\"Piggies\", and finally shortened to \"Piggs\".\n\nThe pregnancy was not easy on Sally. For \nseveral months, morning sickness lasted closer to 24 hours a day.\nHer nausea eventually subsided, but by then Huxley\nhad grown large and active enough to not only earn\nhis moniker, but also to be awarded a prenatal\nblack belt in kung fu.\n\nOn those many late nights and early mornings when \nPiggly woke her up, Sally took to writing verse, \nprimarily haiku, but with a few limericks as well. \n\nThe week before Huxley was born, it occurred to Dan\nthat it might be a nice gift to Sally and Huxley to\ncollect her haiku in book form. After Huxley was born, \nseveral of Sally's friends told her she should publish her\npoems. She eventually said to Dan, \"Maybe I should \ntry to collect all my haiku from Facebook?\" To which\nDan replied, \"I'm one step ahead of you.\"\n"
